        <p>The recipe for spaghetti bolognese is pretty straightforward. You start by bringing a pot of water
            to a boil. While you wait, start browning your choice of ground meat. I prefer beef or turkey. 
            Once the pot has started to boil, add your choice of pasta. Once the pasta is done, strain out the water.
            I usually add a little olive oil to the pot afterwards, then add the pasta back to it. By this point, your pasta
            is done, and hopefully your meat is done as well. Now you add your choice of jarred spaghetti sauce, or a homemade
            sauce. Mix that with the meat and let simmer. Once it has simmered for a bit, you're all done!
